Crime Map
==========
This is a simple crime map I'll be using for an upcoming project in the
newsroom. I figured it might help save another developer some time by including
it so here it is. You'll want to change the hardcoded latitude and longitude in
the base.html template and provide your own yahoo api key (used for the maps).

TODO
=====
* Add in a limit to the number of data points that can be rendered
